redFridge - mintyPT

I forked this in first place to learn about python, json, etc.

This is simply a dict{} containing several keys, your products, and an amount, their value.



How to use this:

1)  load the script
    run fridge.py;

2)  pick your fridge
    f = fridge()

3)  open it
    f.open()

4)  use your fridge like a big boy.


5)  What's next?

    In your fridge you have:
    f.show()

    If you need to add 6 beers, no problem:
    fridge.add('Beer',6)

    If after all you just have 4 beers, just remove 2:
    f.sub('Beer',2)

    How many beers do you have after all?
    f.amountOf('Beer')

    To get rid of everything:
    f.clear()

6)  Don't forget to close it after you're done:
    f.close()
